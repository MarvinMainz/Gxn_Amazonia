# Gxn_Amazonia

This repository contains data on grammaticalization paths from Amazonian languages.
These data have been used for my 2020 MA thesis and are used for preparing several articles as well.

The data sheet includes metadata (language-specific and path-specific), the actual path represented as source-target relation, a glossed example, and values for source and target following the framework of Bisang et al. 2020.
